- Just edit the .l files (plain text files), the .lh will be regenerated
- The limit for the strings is 80 columns .
- Try to use the same style you see on the english strings.
- You can mark bold with "\B" (repeat the char to close the bold)
- You can mark bold with "\U" (repeat the char to close the bold)
- Keep items with the same language order !!!
