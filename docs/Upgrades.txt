  Description: Upgrading how-to

  $Id: Upgrades.txt,v 1.1.1.1 2005/08/27 15:43:50 jpinto Exp $

A few things you should take care when upgrading PTlink IRC Services:

Before upgrading ALWAYS do a full backup of your MySQL db (e.g. using
mysqldump) .

Shutdown your services . If you have the webservices interface, disable it.

You don't need to apply any changes manually, just compile and install
services as for a fresh install.
The configure script will notify you about dconf changes that you may need
to review.
During the inital run of the newer version the modules will update their
tables if required.

If you find a problem during the upgrade visit our web page.
