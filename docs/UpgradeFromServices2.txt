  Description: Upgrading from PTlink Services 2

  $Id: UpgradeFromServices2.txt,v 1.1.1.1 2005/08/27 15:43:49 jpinto Exp $

1) Requirements
.1  PTlink IRC Services 3 data is saved directly on a MySQL DB so you will
    need a mysql DB .
.1  Plain text passwords are not allowed on ircsvs3, if you don't use md5
    encrypted password you must do so by editing services/etc/services.conf 
    and changint EncryptMethod to 3 .
.2  Services2 need to be compiled with mysql support
    check the doc at MySQL/INSTALL from services2 for details on this.   
    Make sure you are installing PTlink.Services2.26-eol.1 
    and you recreate the db structure with services -i .

You can export the services2 data to mysql without needing to run services2
connected to an ircd, just use:

	~/services/bin/listnicks -c  	# (This will export the nick data)
	~/services/bin/listchans -c     # (This will export the chan data)

Ok, you can just install ircsvs3 using the same database configuration, the
existing data will be saved.
