Major changes on the new services version:

Nick security
-------------
The nick and channel registration security was extended with the introduction 
of a nick security code, this code is required for any ownership transfer
operation like setting a new email or changing a channel founder.
If you don't have a security code because your nick was already registered
just set a new email with:
  /NickServ SET EMAIL your_email
If you whish to have your email hidden from nickserv information requests
just type:
  /NickServ SET HIDEEMAIL on

Setting the auto join channel list
----------------------------------
The auto join list is now defined with a single command:
  /NickServ SET AUTOJOIN #Chan1,#Chan2...
Note: Do not use spaces between channel names.

Channel ownership
-----------------
The channel password was removed. Only the channel founder is recognized as
the channel owner, to drop or transfer a channel the nick security code is
required.

Channel Roles (Old access list)
-------------------------------
The channel access list was replaced by the roles list, a role defines the
group of actions and privileges assigned to the role member's. 
An user can have a single role on a given channel.
By default 4 roles are created after the channel registration: admin,
operator, voice and akick. 
To view the list of roles available on a channel you must use:
  /ChanServ ROLE #Chan VIEW
The default "admin" role is defined with actions to send a notice (when
defined) and set chanmode +a when he joins a channel.
The "operator" role is similar but sets chanmode +o on join.
On the chanserv role view you can also see between "[]" the master role of a
given role. The master role has privileges to add/remove members to the
mastered role, for the "operatpr" role case the master role is "admin" .
To add a nick to a channel role you use the command:
  /ChanServ ROLE #Chan ADD role nick message
For example to add nick "Lamego" with "Operator" on "#Portugal" .
  /ChanServ ROLE #Portugal ADD Operator Lamego Hello operator !
The message is an optional parameter, if defined will be sent as a notice
to the channel when the nick joins.
Role masters can change/set a role user message with the setmsg command:
  //ChanServ ROLE #Chan SETMSG nick message

More about roles
----------------
The default roles are ok for most of the users however roles allow to
define more customized roles which can make more sense with the channel.
Let's imagine a channel #Zoo.
You can create a role Lion:
  /ChanServ ROLE #Zoo CREATE Lion admin aop,msg:opdeop
A Lion user is masted by admin and will set +o and send a notice when the
user joins the channel. It will also be able to use the chanserv op/deop
commands.
Then you can create a monkey role:
  /ChanServ ROLE #Zoo CREATE Monkey Lion avoice:invite
Monkeys will get +v on join and can use chanserv invite.
Now lets add nick Bob and nick Sam to the roles.
  /ChanServ ROLE #Zoo Add Lion Bob Here is the king !
  /ChanServ ROLE #Zoo Add Monkey Sam Uhhuuuuuhhh Ahhhhhhhhh...
