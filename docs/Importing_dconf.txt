As of PTlink 3.5.0 the text based .dconf files were replaced with db stored
settings.
# To make sure the new required modules will be loaded on startup do:
# rm ~/ircsvs/etc/ircsvs.modules before "make install"
To import the settings from the .dconf files proceed as described:
# Dump all the .dconf to a single file
cat ~/ircsvs/etc/*.dconf > ~/full.dconf
# Now run the imput script on it
source_dir/utils/import_dconf.sh ~/full.dconf > ~/dconf.sh
cd ~/ircsvs/bin
sh ~/dconf.sh
# Cleanup the tmp files, they have the mysql db passwords
rm ~/full.dconf ~/tmp/dconf.sh
# Please note that you must manually configure the NickSecurityCode option
# because its function was inverted.
