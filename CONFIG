As of PTlink Services 3.5.0 the configuration was moved to the database .
You can view/edit the configuration by using the ircsvs conf command.
Change to the ircsvs bin dir...
To get a list of configuration items type:
  ./ircsvs conf list
To edit an item:
  ./ircsvs conf set item value
For string values you must use "value"
  ./ircsvs conf set item "value"
For time items you must specify a number followed by a time char :
  ./ircsvs conf set item value[mhdMY]
There are some optional items which can be unset to disable some functions,
for those items you can use:
  ./ircsvs conf unset item
If you want to edit the configuration from a text file and then apply it to
the database you can do it by using the conf export command:
  ./ircsvs conf export > fullconf.sh
Later you can apply the config by executing the export file as a script:
  sh fullconf.sh
