  $Id: INSTALL,v 1.5 2005/10/16 17:31:32 jpinto Exp $

************************************************************************
*** Requirements

-- MySQL
You need a MySQL database to store services data. The software was
developed and tested with MySQL 4.0.23 .
You will need the mysql development libraries installed on the system.  

--- IRCd
The only supported IRCd version is the PTlink IRCd available from:
	http://software.pt-link.net

*** Install instructions
Run the configure script with:
 ./configure --prefix=install_path

Build with "make"

Install with "make install"

*** Configuration
Edit ~/ircsvs/etc/ircsvs.conf and put your mysql db configuration.

*** Database tables creation
Just run install_dir/bin/ircsvs with the default configuration, 
If services can't connect to the mysql db they will ask you for the MySQL root
password to create the db and the user if required.
You don't need to manually create the db tables, the modules will create their
own tables when the modules are loaded for the first time.

Once the module tables are created you must setup all the required
configuration items using ircsvs with the "conf" command:
  ./ircsvs conf SET irc.ServerName services.ptlink.net
  ./ircsvs conf SET irc.ServerDesc PTlink Services 3
  ./ircsvs conf SET irc.ServerPass servpass
  ./ircsvs conf SET irc.RemoteServer 127.0.0.1
  ./ircsvs conf SET irc.RemotePort 6667
To list all the other options:
  ircsvs conf list
Or just the unconfigured(default) options:
  ircsvs conf list * missing

*** For more details about configuration read the file CONFIG

*** Setting the first root nick
After defining all the options you need you must set an inital Root nick to
be able to use the NickServ GROUP ADD command , do it:
  ircsvs conf SET ns_group ROOT nick
Please note that on your first services run you must define the Root nick on
the db:
  /NickServ GROUP ADD ROOT nick
